During the 2022-2023 school year, UCSB is migrating to Canvas as it's 
Course Management System (CMS).  By Fall 2023, support for the prior CMS,
Gauchospace, will be dropped.

A key benefit of Canvas is the ability to have a secure centralized gradebook, i.e. one where:

* Instructors, TAs and readers have read/write access to all grades
* Students have read only access to only their own grade

Other benefits:

* Adding/dropping is automatic, and synchronized with course enrollment
* All students and faculty already have a username/password (their existing UCSBNetID).

A consideration whenusing Canvas for actual curriculum *content*  (e.g. content of lectures, labs, homework and programming
assignments) is that typically only students enrolled in the course can see that content.   This can make sharing curriculum resources more cumbersome.

## Setting up a reasonable subset of Canvas

When you get a new Canvas course set up, one of the first decisions you need to make is:

* **Which parts of Canvas** am I going to use?

It isn't immediately obvious where you do this.  Here's how:

1. Find the Settings menu option at the bottom of the left navigation:

2. Click Settings, and it will take you to this:

3. Now, you want to click where it says `Navigation`, and you'll end up here:

4. There are two parts of this page:
   * The collection of things that are being used in the course are in the top part
   * The collection of things that are **not** being used in the course are in the bottom part
   * Then **don't forget to scroll down and click SAVE** or else your changes won't stick!
   
   Drag things into the top part if you want to use them; drag things to the bottom if you don't.  For example, here's a typical collection of tools
   that might be used for CMPSC 16:
