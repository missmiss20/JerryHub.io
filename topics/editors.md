# Some options

* Simple terminal based editors on CSIL:
   * [`vim`](/topics/vim.html)
   * [`emacs`](/topics/emacs.html)
* Simple graphical editors on CSIL:
   * [`atom`](/topics/atom.html)
   * [`code`](/topics/vscode.html) Visual Studio Code (`code` command on CSIL, also known as "vscode")

# Our advice

* Learn at least "survival vim": 
   * You'll need that skill for working with cloud systems, backend systems, in situations
     where you only have a command line, and not a graphical environment.
   * You don't necessarily need to be able to do sophisticated editing, but you should be able
     to do these [eight basic vim functions](/topics/vim_basic_eight/): quit without saving, enter code, save, copy/paste, 
     search/replace, show line numbers, goto a line number, save as.
* Learn either atom or vscode
   * These provide helpful editing capabilities that are sensitive to your particular
     programming language including auto-completion, early detection of syntax errors,
     integration with version control, and many more features that you'll come to appreciate
     as you progress as a programmer.
